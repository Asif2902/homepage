        <h1>Coin Flip Is A Decentralized Application</h1>

        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        <p>The Coin Flip Decentralized Application (DApp) is a fun and transparent platform built on the Katla test net. It offers users a simple yet exciting opportunity to engage in a fair 50/50 chance game, where they can wager and potentially win cryptocurrency by correctly predicting the outcome of a coin flip.</p>

        <h2>Features:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> The DApp operates on the Katla test net, leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency and fairness in every coin flip.</li>
            <li><strong>Immutable Smart Contracts:</strong> The core logic of the coin flip game is executed through immutable smart contracts, guaranteeing that the rules of the game cannot be altered or manipulated by any party.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparent Odds:</strong> With a fixed 50/50 chance to win, users can trust that the outcome of each coin flip is determined purely by chance, without any interference or bias.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Transactions:</strong> All transactions within the DApp are conducted securely on the blockchain, providing users with confidence in the integrity of their wagers and winnings.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> The DApp features an intuitive interface that allows users to easily place their bets, monitor game outcomes, and withdraw their winnings with minimal hassle.</li>

            <li><strong>Flip Coin:</strong> Once the bet is placed, the smart contract executes a fair coin flip, with equal chances of landing on heads or tails.</li>
            <li><strong>Outcome Determination:</strong> The result of the coin flip is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.</li>
            <li><strong>Win or Lose:</strong> Depending on the outcome of the coin flip, the user either wins their wagered amount multiplied by two (if they guessed correctly) or loses their wager.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdraw Winnings:</strong> Users can easily withdraw their winnings to their connected wallet at any time, providing a seamless and convenient experience.</li>
